# E-commerce-web-page
It is  a simple e-commerce web page created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It can add and remove items as well.
In this example, we have a product list section with three products. Each product has a name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. Clicking the button triggers the addToCart function, which adds the item to the cart.
The cart section initially shows a placeholder item indicating that the cart is empty. When items are added to the cart, the renderCart function retrieves the cart items from the local storage and dynamically renders them in the cart section. Each cart item has a name, price, and a "Remove" button. Clicking the "Remove" button triggers the removeFromCart function, which removes the item from the cart.
